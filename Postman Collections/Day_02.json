Expand the context bar on the right to follow the instructions in the collection documentation. Remember, if you find it bothersome to navigate between the documentation while working in a different area of Postman, you can open a new tab to keep your place in the documentation, and then switch between tabs.\n3. **Submit your solution:** Select the second folder `Submit your solution` and follow the instructions in the documentation to validate your solution.\n    \n\n## Concepts covered\n\n- [Adding requests](https://learning.postman.com/docs/sending-requests/intro-to-collections/#adding-requests)\n- [Creating environments](https://learning.postman.com/docs/sending-requests/managing-environments/#creating-environments)\n- [Postman API](https://learning.postman.com/docs/developer/intro-api/)\n    \n\n## Additional resources\n\n- [Postman Environments: How to Control Access to Variables, Workflows, and More](https://blog.postman.com/postman-environments-how-to-control-access-to-variables-workflows-and-more/) blog\n- [Initial vs Current Values for Variables](https://youtu.be/I6vClap0ajU) video\n- [Collections and environments](https://www.tiktok.com/@joycejetson/video/7061999729462250799) tiktok\n    \n\n## Next challenge\n\n- [Add request details](https://www.postman.com/postman/workspace/30-days-of-postman-for-developers/documentation/1559645-969f4824-25ba-4ed6-8926-f71ce4ee079d)",

Now that you've stored the base URL in a variable named `baseURL`, you can reference it in your requests using `{{baseURL}}`. If the base URL value is `https://postman-echo.com`, and is listed as part of the request URL using `{{baseURL}}/post`, Postman will send the request to `https://postman-echo.com/post`. Save your changes in the collection and environment.\n3. **Add a request:** Rename the request from `echo` to `POST raw text`. Then, duplicate the request in this folder, and rename the second request `GET with query params`. Update the new request HTTP method to `GET` and update the request URL from `/post` to `/get`. Add two [query parameters](https://learning.postman.com/docs/sending-requests/requests/#sending-parameters). This can be anything you like, for example, `foo` and `bar` or `name` and `ferret`. **Send** to make sure you get a 200 status code.\n    \n\nOnce you complete these steps, move on to the next folder in this collection to submit your solution."

Paste the API key under `CURRENT VALUE` (and not `INITIAL VALUE`).> ⚠ DON'T LEAK YOUR SECRETS!  \n    It's very important to add sensitive values like an API key to the `CURRENT VALUE` (and not `INITIAL VALUE`) of your public workspace since initial values can be viewed publicly in a public workspace. Storing sensitive values only in `CURRENT VALUE` keeps your secrets private in a team or public workspace. If you accidentally show your API key, [revoke and regenerate your API key](https://go.postman.co/settings/me/api-keys).An environment can be used with other collections. Keep it handy, so we can use it in upcoming challenges.\n4. **Validate your solution**: Save your changes in the collection and environment. Hit **Send** and look under the **Tests** tab of the server response at the bottom to review your test results.\n    \n\nIf you have any failures, [review the failed test results](https://youtu.be/S3GKLTVRtmE) or ask for support in the [community forum](https://community.postman.com/). When all of your tests pass, you are done with today's challenge. Remember to save your changes as you'll need to pass all the challenges to claim a **30 days of Postman** badge."
